# Visualizations-using-Matplotlib-Seaborn
Overview
This project explores the "historical_automobile_sales" dataset to analyze trends in automobile sales during various recession periods. The analysis aims to provide insights into how economic downturns have impacted sales and consumer behavior in the automobile industry.

Libraries Used
This analysis utilizes the following libraries:

Pandas: For data management
NumPy: For mathematical operations
Matplotlib: For data visualization
Seaborn: For enhanced plotting capabilities
Recession Periods Analyzed
The analysis focuses on the following recession periods:

1980
1981 to 1982
1991
2000 to 2001
End of 2007 to mid-2009
February to April 2020 (Covid-19 Impact)
Objectives
By examining the various factors from the dataset, this analysis aims to gain insights into how recessions have impacted automobile sales for your company. Through visualizations and statistical analysis, we will identify trends and correlations in automobile sales during these economic downturns.

This project is based on exercises from the Labs in the "Data Visualization with Python" course that I have completed on Coursera online learning platform and is part of the "IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate" by Coursera.
